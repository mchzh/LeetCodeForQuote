It is easy to know that at grid P, since " at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately", the remaining health value should be at least 1, that is, initialHealth + dungeon >= 1, we have initialHealth = max(1, 1 - dungeon[i][j]). (Notice, at any grid, the initial health should be at least 1 (for example, test case [1,0,0] require initial health 1 even though it has positive remaining health at grid[0][1] and grid[0][2])
Similarly, to satisfy the initial health of dungeon[i][j], the initial health of dungeon[i-1][j] (or dungeon[i][j-1]) should be at least initialHealth[i-1][j] + dungeon[i-1][j] = initialHealth[i][j], that is, initialHealth[i][j] = initialHealth[i][j] - dungeon[i-1][j].
In addition, if grid[i][j] can go both grid[i+1][j] and grid[i][j+1] to P, we should choose a path with less initial health between grid[i+1][j] and grid[i][j+1] since it require less initial health of grid[i][j].
